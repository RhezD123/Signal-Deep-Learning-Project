# Signal Deep Learning Project
Classifies 5G, LTE, WLAN spectrum photos with 98% accuracy.

I got the idea from a github repository full of projets to complete. I used a combination of a MathWorks guide that shows how to complete this task as well as my own 
knowledge. 

This is the MathWorks website: https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/ug/spectrum-sensing-with-deep-learning-to-identify-5g-and-lte-signals.html

This website is also where I got the data from (You can find the link to download the dataset in the Training script file).
